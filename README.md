# fun-feathers-js-discriminator

Instead of strict inheritance, Mongoose uses discriminators as their schema inheritance model. To use them, pass in a discriminatorKey option to your schema object and use Model.discriminator('modelName', schema) instead of mongoose.model()

Feathers comes with full support for mongoose discriminators, allowing for automatic fetching of inherited types.
